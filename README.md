# Outlet Store Sales Predictor: Project Overview
- Developed and refined a model that predicts product sales for an outlet store, leveraging over 8000 records of product sales
- Explored patterns and discovered meaningful insights through various forms of data visualization after several steps of data cleaning
- Evaluated Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosted Regressor, and other models to procure the best model for this scenario, as scored by accuracy and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Tuned the best model, Lasso, using GridSearchCV to enhance performance and proficiency
This model has real world appliations in multiple forms, such as forecasting store business and economic trends.
